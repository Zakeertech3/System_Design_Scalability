## 🌍 Explore the Web, Asynchronously!

Ever felt like web scraping is painfully slow, waiting for one site to respond before moving on to the next? Imagine if you could send out multiple scouts at once, each collecting information independently—speeding up the process exponentially. That’s exactly what this **Scalable Async Web Scraper** does!

Built with **Python, asyncio, aiohttp, and Streamlit**, this tool allows you to scrape multiple websites **concurrently** with ease, all from an interactive dashboard.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

It all started with a simple problem—scraping multiple sites took forever. Traditional synchronous scraping felt like standing in a long queue, waiting for each response before moving forward. But by leveraging **asynchronous programming**, we turned it into a **high-speed, multi-tasking operation**!

✨ **How?**
- **Async I/O (asyncio + aiohttp)**: Multiple requests are handled simultaneously instead of sequentially.
- **Concurrency Control (Semaphores)**: Limits the number of active requests to prevent system overload.
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Provides an interactive way to input URLs, set concurrency levels, and see results in real time.

Now, whether you’re scraping **3 websites or 300**, this scraper ensures efficiency without freezing your system.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### 🔹 Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.7 or later** installed on your system.

### 🔹 Installation Steps
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Zakeertech3/System_Design_Scalability.git

## 🎮 How It Works

1️⃣ Enter the list of URLs you want to scrape in the Streamlit dashboard.  
2️⃣ Set the **maximum number of concurrent requests** (controls performance & system load).  
3️⃣ Hit **Start Scraping** – watch as multiple scouts (requests) gather data asynchronously.  
4️⃣ View **live results** in the table with website responses, status codes, and content.
